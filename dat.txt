Human Activity Recognition Using Accelerometer Data


Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the WISDM dataset, which contains accelerometer data collected from 51 users performing six different activities: walking, jogging, upstairs, downstairs, sitting, and standing. 
The dataset consists of 1,098,207 examples, with each example representing a single data point from the accelerometer.



Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed to remove any errors and inconsistencies. 
The data is read into a native Python file and then processed to remove any extra spaces and semicolons. 
The processed data is then converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.



Data Balancing
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with some activities having significantly more examples than others. 
To address this issue, we take only the first 3555 lines for each activity into separate lists and create a balanced dataset using these lists.



Data Standardization
The feature space is standardized using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to bring all the values into the same range.

Frame Preparation
The data is divided into frames of 4 seconds, with a hop size of 40 observations. 
The label for each frame is the mode of the labels for the 80 observations that make up the frame.

2D CNN Model
A Sequential model is used to build the 2D CNN. 
The model consists of two Conv2D layers with ReLU activation, followed by a Flatten layer, two Dense layers with ReLU activation, and a final Dense layer with softmax activation.



Model Compilation and Training
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. 
The model is trained on the training data for 10 epochs, with validation on the test data.

Model Evaluation
The model's accuracy and loss are plotted using the plot_learningCurve function. 
The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, which shows that the model is getting 100% accuracy for sitting and standing, but is getting confused between upstairs and downstairs.



Conclusion
The model achieves a decent accuracy for human activity recognition using accelerometer data. 
To further improve the accuracy, we can try training the model with more data.
